You have been found that there are lights which intensity is constant in a venue, you are asked to design a circuit so you can change the intensity of the light according to the outside light. Let's consider you have the following parts available:
i) Arduino Uno Board 
ii) A LED/Bulb 
iii) An LDR 
iv) Couple of jumper cable &amp;
v) USB Cable to connect the board 
The proto-type that will control the venue light to ensure maximum light comfort level for everyone. How can you design such a system? Draw the complete circuit diagram with Proper justification for each component? Provide an estimated cost as well for the system. Serial Communication to show value of LDR
